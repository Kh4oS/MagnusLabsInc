# Introduction

This is a project dedicated to the development of resources and a knowledge base
for the game EVE Online.

I've decided to use GitHub as a platform for a few reasons:
- version control,
- collaboration,
- built-in wiki, and
- the relative ease with which these tasks are accomplished.

If you'd like to contribute to the Wiki, simply clone the wiki, make your
changes, and then send a pull request for one of the project collaborators to
review.

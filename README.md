# Introduction

This is a project dedicated to the development of resources and a knowledge base
for the game EVE Online.

I've decided to use GitHub as a platform for a few reasons:
- version control,
- collaboration,
- built-in wiki, and
- the relative ease with which these tasks are accomplished.

If you'd like to contribute to the Wiki,
- Clone the wiki, make your
- Make the changes / additions to your local version
- Create a pull request so that one of our collaborators can review the content.

For more information on how Git/GitHub work, check out:

The main collaborators (character names) on the Wiki are:
- Vikros Crendraven
- Leviston Forkhammer

Send a game mail to these characters if you'd like to be added as a collaborator
to the Wiki. Otherwise, follow the above instructions if you'd like to contribute.

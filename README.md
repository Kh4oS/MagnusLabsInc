# Introduction

This is a project dedicated to the development of resources and a knowledge base
for the game EVE Online. This will be personalized for our corporation but will
feature general information as well.

I've decided to use GitHub as a platform for a few reasons:
- version control,
- collaboration,
- built-in wiki,
- the relative ease with which these tasks are accomplished, and
- we also offer programming expertise to capsuleers for ISK
    - GitHub is an amazing place to share said expertise.

If you have a programming solution you would like us to develop for you (whether
it is related to EVE Online or not), please contact Queldonas Caelin with a
**game mail** and let him know what your needs or requirements are for software.

# Contributing or Collaborating

If you'd like to contribute to the Wiki,
- Clone the wiki to your computer,
- Make the changes / additions to your local version
- Create a pull request so that one of our collaborators can review/approve the content.

For more information on how Git and GitHub work, check out: <a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a>

The main contributors to this project are:
- EVE Online Name: Vikros Crendraven // GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Kh4oS">Kh4oS</a>
- EVE Online Name: Leviston Forkhammer // GitHub: TBD

Send a **game mail** to these characters if you'd like to be added as a permanent
collaborator to the Wiki - we'll work out a time for a meeting to discuss what we
can offer each other.

# Future Goals

Once basic content is developed for this wiki, we plan on essentially datamining
other sources with the power of the Python programming language and the modules
scrapy and BeautifulSoup.

Once the information on this wiki reaches a critical mass, it will be refactored
and hosted on a separate host to ensure continuity. Not that GitHub's future is
in any doubt - it's just always best to have contigencies in case limits are imposed
on traffic or other conditions.
